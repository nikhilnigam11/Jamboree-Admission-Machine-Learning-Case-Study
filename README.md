Graduate Admission Predictor
A Linear Regression Model to Predict Admission Chances for Graduate Programs

📌 Overview

This project analyzes factors influencing graduate school admissions and builds a predictive model to estimate a student's chance of admission using Linear Regression. The dataset includes academic metrics (GRE, TOEFL, CGPA), university ratings, and research experience.

Key Features:

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

✅ Multicollinearity handling using VIF & correlation analysis

✅ Linear Regression model with 81.8% accuracy (R²)

✅ Assumption testing (Homoscedasticity, Normality, Linearity)

✅ Actionable insights for students and educational consultants

🔍 Key Findings
Top Predictors of Admission:

✅ CGPA (strongest correlation: 0.88)
✅ GRE Score (0.81)
✅ TOEFL Score (0.79)
✅ Research Experience increases admission chances by ~5%.
✅ University Rating has moderate impact (correlation: 0.69).

📊 Model Performance Metric	Score
✅ R²	0.818
✅ Adjusted R²	0.805
✅ MAE	0.042
✅ RMSE	0.061

💡 Recommendations
For Jamboree (Educational Consultants):
✅ Integrate the model into an Admission Probability Calculator on their platform.
✅ Offer personalized coaching for students with predicted chances <70%.

🛠️ Tech Stack
✅ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
✅ Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, StandardScaler, Train-Test Split)
✅ Statsmodels (VIF, Residual Analysis)
